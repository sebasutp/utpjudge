 * This will crash the judging daemon: it forks processes and places
 * these in a new session, such that testcase_run cannot retrace and
 * kill these. They are left running and should be killed before
 * restarting the judging daemon.
 *
 * This is not really that bad: any team submitting this kind of code
 * should be disqualified anyways. Furthermore only this judging
 * daemon is affected and can be restarted easily. It aborts on
 * purpose to force checking of the reasons of a crash.
